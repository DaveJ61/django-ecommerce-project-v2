This course is designed for beginners and intermediates who primarily seek to further their understanding developing with the Python Django Framework and associated technologies. I have tried to design this course to be modular so that you could also focus in on particular topics, tutorials or aspects of Django should you prefer this mode of learning or simply are interested in individual aspects of the development process.
